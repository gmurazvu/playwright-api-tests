# Cox Automotive – QA Automation Technical Exercise  

**FakeStore API | Playwright + TypeScript**
 
This repository contains an API automation test suite built using **Playwright** and **TypeScript** to validate user workflows described in the Cox Automotive QA technical exercise.
 
The focus of this solution is on:

- Clear mapping to **user stories and acceptance criteria**

- Maintainable and readable test structure

- Reusable API abstractions

- Meaningful assertions and defensive testing
 
---
 
## Tech Stack

- **Playwright Test**

- **TypeScript**

- **Node.js**

## API Under Test

- FakeStore API: https://fakestoreapi.com  

- Reference: https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api

Setup Instructions
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Install dependencies

Run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Playwright browsers

Run once:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Running the tests

- Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Run a specific user story:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/userStory1.spec.ts
```

- Run tests in headed mode:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

- View HTML test report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Test Coverage

#### User Story 1

As an online shopper, view all available products and validate adding the cheapest electronics item.

Coverage:

- Retrieve product list (GET /products)
- Filter by `electronics` category
- Consider only in-stock items (`rating.count > 0`)
- Select the cheapest qualifying product
- Assert category and price validity

Note: FakeStore API does not provide a cart endpoint — "add to cart" is represented by validating the selected product.

#### User Story 2

As a store manager, add three new clothing items to the catalogue.

Coverage:

- Add products (POST /products)
- Assert successful creation
- Verify products appear in the catalogue (GET /products)

Note: Duplicate-rejection behavior may not be enforced by the FakeStore API and is documented accordingly.

#### User Story 3

As a store admin, delete the product with the lowest rating.

Coverage:

- Identify product with lowest rating
- Delete the product (DELETE /products/:id)
- Attempt retrieval of deleted product

Known API limitation: FakeStore API may not persist deletions; tests document this limitation.

### Assumptions

- Product availability is approximated using `rating.count > 0`.
- Product IDs are generated by the API.
- Category values follow FakeStore API responses.

### Future Improvements

- JSON schema validation
- Additional negative tests
- CI pipeline integration
- Improved logging and reporting

### Notes for Reviewers

This solution prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and business intent within the scope of the exercise. I'm happy to walk through design decisions, tradeoffs, and improvements during the interview.
